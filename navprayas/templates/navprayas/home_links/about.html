					<p style="text-align: center;">
						<strong>'NAVPRAYAS’</strong>, a Hindi word that means ‘New effort’, is a voluntary organization established in the year 2000 with the motive of the upliftment of the native society (Manpur Patwatoli) in the educational, social and moral aspects. It is a team of society students studying in different colleges under various streams across the globe.<br><br>
						This group allows us to think together in a better way for spreading the light of education, matching the present scenario and other technical/non-technical developments in Manpur. We as a team leave no stone unturned in honoring those who set a milestone in dignifying our society through their dormant achievements. We, a group of innovative thinkers, feel that a lot needs to be done, can be done & should be done to bring it to par with the rest of society.
